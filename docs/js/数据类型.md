The latest ECMAScript standard defines nine types:

## primitive
[[primitive]]
Six Data Types that are primitives, checked by typeof operator:

undefined : typeof instance === "undefined"
Boolean : typeof instance === "boolean"
Number : typeof instance === "number"
String : typeof instance === "string"
BigInt : typeof instance === "bigint"
Symbol : typeof instance === "symbol"

## Structural Types

- Object : typeof instance === "object". Special non-data but Structural type for any constructed object instance also used as data structures: new Object, new Array, new Map, new Set, new WeakMap, new WeakSet, new Date and almost everything made with new keyword;

- Function : a non-data structure, though it also answers for typeof operator: typeof instance === "function". This is merely a special shorthand for Functions, though every Function constructor is derived from Object constructor.

- Structural Root Primitive:
null : typeof instance === "object". Special primitive type having additional usage for its value: if object is not inherited, then null is shown;
